Game inspired by 2048 implemented in awk

USAGE

onetenth [ -s ] [ awkopts ]
onetenth.awk [ awkopts ]

-s screen mode

awkopts:

seed=""

# must be lower case
wkey="h"
nkey="k"
skey="j"
ekey="l"
qkey="q"

rows=4
cols=4

syms="ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ*"
high=11

esym="." # empty symbol

bl="" # blank lines

cl="" # clear
hi=""
lo=""

# must match from frist character on line
comment="##"

# if the first char is |, then it is a command to pipe into
of=""

EXAMPLES

have upper case hilighted symbols

onetenth esym="  ." syms="  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k"

use hex symbols

onetenth esym="   ." syms="   1   2   4   8  10  20  40  80 100 200 400" bl='\n' cl='\n'

emulate a hc (hardcopy) device that supports os (overstrike), the ^H is bs
(backspace) and varies on system and shell how to enter - typically you can
press ^V (control+v) and then ^H (control+h)

onetenth esym="   ." syms="   2   4   8  16  32  64 128 256 512  1K  2K" hi='_^H' of="|/usr/bin/ul"

clear screen and reverse video highlight

./onetenth -s esym="   ." syms="   1   2   4   8  10  20  40  80 100 200 400" bl='\n'
